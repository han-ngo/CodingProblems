# Coding Problems

Most of these problems can be found in the book [Cracking The Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). Otherwise, they are on some Online Programming Learning Platform (organized in the "Misc." folder), such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems), etc.

I post my solutions (in Java) here for my own reference.
